I'm also looking for a fulltime job or contract work. Hire me!;After a long hiatus as a parent raising my daughter through 1st grade, I took a General Assembly bootcamp which ended March 2022. Now I'm dishing up a full stack of Python and SQL like hotcakes!</p><p>Also, in my spare time since 2013 I have been doing a service project partnering with an Rwandan organization to help kids learn to read earlier. So I am now spending about half my months in Rwanda, three-months-on, three-months-off. While I am in the USA, my family and I are based in Laconia, New Hampshire, USA. However, I can travel as needed your position during this time.;img/Steven_headshot_500px.jpg
rongzi;streamlit_webapp,github;https://rongzi.bhrdwj.net, https://github.com/bhrdj/rongzi;Rongzi finds optimal network paths connecting Chinese characters based on a character decomposition database.;"Users may find meaning in paths between adjacent characters in names or proverbs etc.</p><p>Many Chinese characters are composed of sub-components which may contribute meaning to the larger character. For instance, 好 is composed of 女 (woman) and 子 (child). These composition/decomposition relationships form a graph network.<br><br>Rongzi finds these paths by recursively querying a <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Chinese_characters_decomposition"">Chinese Character Decomposition</a> database.<br><br> Completed April 2022";img/rongzi.jpg
